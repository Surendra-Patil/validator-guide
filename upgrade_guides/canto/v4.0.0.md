git pull --force --tag
git checkout v4.0.0
make install
```

# check the version

```bash
# should be 4.0.0
cantod version
# Should be commit 2d84eaa2af111e1ab740ab8ece4ccb92ac39b15f
cantod version --long
```

# Make new directory and copy binary

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.cantod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v4.0.0/bin
cp $HOME/go/bin/cantod $HOME/.cantod/cosmovisor/upgrades/v4.0.0/bin
```

# check the version again
