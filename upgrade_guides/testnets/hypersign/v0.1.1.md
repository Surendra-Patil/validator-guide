The Upgrade is scheduled for block `182500`. A countdown clock is [here](https://explorer.nodestake.top/hypersign-testnet/gov/2)

This guide assumes that you use cosmovisor to manage upgrades

```bash
# get the new version
cd hypersign
git pull
git checkout v0.1.1
make install
```

# check the version

```bash
# should be v0.1.1
hid-noded version
# Should be commit 9001a06
hid-noded version --long
```

# Make new directory and copy binary

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.hid-node/cosmovisor/upgrades/v011/bin
cp $HOME/go/bin/hid-noded $HOME/.hid-node/cosmovisor/upgrades/v011/bin
```

# check the version again

```bash
# should be v0.1.1
$HOME/.hid-node/cosmovisor/upgrades/v011/bin/hid-noded version
