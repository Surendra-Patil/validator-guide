# Persistence v4.0.0 Upgrade

The Upgrade is scheduled for block `8589500`. A countdown clock is [here](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/blocks/8589500)

This guide assumes that you use cosmovisor to manage upgrades

```bash
# get the new version
cd persistence
git pull
git checkout v4.0.0
make install
```

# check the version

```bash
# should be v4.0.0
persistenceCore version
# Should be commit 3b20fa8292cb8018ab2d277a67131679e7635901
persistenceCore version --long | grep commit
```

# Make new directory and copy binary

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.persistenceCore/cosmovisor/upgrades/v4/bin
cp $HOME/go/bin/persistenceCore $HOME/.persistenceCore/cosmovisor/upgrades/v4/bin
```

# check the version again

```bash
# should be v4.0.0
$HOME/.persistenceCore/cosmovisor/upgrades/v4/bin/persistenceCore version
```
